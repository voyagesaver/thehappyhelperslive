                        <p class="mbr-fonts-style mbr-text mbr-regular align-left pt-3 display-4"><br><strong>Learning English:</strong><br>
<br>Where do you want to study? Have you ever considered studying abroad? Countries like the United States and the United Kingdom are home to some of the world's most greatest universities and colleges. And even in non-English speaking countries, there are thousands of good schools around the globe offering their programs in English. Which means learning English might mean accessing a better education.<br><br>The English language is currently the most frequently used and widely spoken language in the world. One in every 5 individuals has the ability to speak or understand English. Learning English increases your chances of achieving success in a dream career, facilities in professional development, networking, and gives you the possibility to participate freely in English conversations and discussions. Most notably, English will help to increase your future educational and professional opportunities. 
<br><br>English is the primary language used for business. It is therefore paramount that you have a working knowledge and understanding of English – particularly when speaking to international colleagues, customers, or clients. English can also allow you to expand your company or business, even while working abroad in a non-English speaking country.
<br><br><strong>Widely Spoken
</strong><br>When considering why learning English is important, this is perhaps the greatest factor you ought to consider. One in five individuals in the entire world can speak, or at least understand, English. It is 	particularly useful for both travel and communication. 
<br><br><strong>Career Booster
</strong><br>As the primary language of business, it is important – unequivocally – to know how to speak English when speaking with international colleagues or customers. Having English language skills increases your chances of earning a good job, either in a multi-national company or from abroad. 
<br><br><strong>Easy to Learn</strong>
<br>The vocabulary and pronunciation in English can be difficult to learn. However, English grammar, in comparison to other Western languages, is relatively easy. For instance, there are only two genders, masculine and feminine. Additionally, there is only one definite and indefinite article, and the rules are 	relatively simple and straightforward.
<br><br><strong>Valuable for Education
</strong><br>Where do you want to study? Have you considered studying abroad? The United States and the United Kingdom are home to some of the world’s greatest universities. Non-English-speaking countries also possess some of the world’s greatest schools and programs – although these options are often in English. Thus, it is recommended that you learn English in order to access a higher quality education.
<br><br><strong>Rich in Literature and Popular Culture</strong>
<br>Have you ever heard a song and wished you could understand the lyrics? Have you ever been frustrated by a poor dub of a television show or movie? Perhaps you have desired to experience and understand the masterful works of English writers, including J.K. Rowling, Stephen King, and Jane Austen. If you relate to these, then you ought to learn English. You will finally be able to understand and relate to your favorite books, movies, television shows, and songs in their untapped and original form. 
<br><br><strong>Additional Notes
</strong><br>- About 1,500,000,000 people in the world speak English. Another 1,000,000,000 are learning it.
<br>- 75% of the world’s letters and postcards are written in English.
<br>- Almost all international conferences and competitions are conducted in English. For example, The Olympics and The Miss World contests.
<br>- Diplomats and politicians from different countries use English to communicate with one another. English is the main language of organizations including The United Nations, NATO, and the European Free Trade Association.  
<br><br><strong>If you can communicate in English, you can:</strong>
<br>
<br>Contact people from around the world. Talk about your ideas and opinions 	on Internet discussion groups. Send e-mails to interesting people. Learn about their lives and their culture.
Travel more easily. Communicate with people wherever you go — English is spoken in more than 100 countries. Ask directions, have a conversation, ask for help. Who knows, perhaps English will save your life!
